1.14, 1.15, 1.16 GeruDoku - Minecraft

[This thread](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/2895569-gerudoku-legacy-thread-1-14-coming-soon-32x) is the last work I could find on this texture pack. I want to maintain it so we can remember the good old days of the Yogscast Minecraft Survival series.

I've updated it to work with 1.16. I don't plan on creating art for anything that's missing. I'm maintaining it so that it works with the current version of Minecraft.
